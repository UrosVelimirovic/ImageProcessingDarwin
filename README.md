# Build:

Project was developed in visual studio 22.

All you need to do is copy and paste all .h and .cpp files into a new empty project and run it.

WARNING: If you run the project in visual studio, there's a chance that it may not run because of secure warnings (_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS). 
This is easily solvable by adding 
#pragma warning(disable:4996) above main. 

If that doesn't work you can try any solutions found on the link below or anywhere online, since this is a common problem in visual studio.
